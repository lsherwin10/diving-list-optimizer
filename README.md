# diving-list-optimizer
Takes as input a diver's name and scrapes divemeets.com to find their average dive scores and generates an optimal list. You can generate lists for 6 dives and _(coming soon)_ 11 dives, adhering to the voluntary DD requirement.

Change into the working directory and run `python3 main.py` to be prompted for a diver's name and have results printed to the console.
